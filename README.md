# Equity and Inclusive Growth Indicators Analysis

## Project Overview

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis comparing the PlanRVA (MPO) footprint data—or Richmond Region, as available—with other regions on Equity and Inclusive Growth Indicators, with a specific focus on underserved populations.

### What Defines Underserved Populations?

For the purposes of this analysis, **underserved populations** are defined by the EDA as including Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and other persons of color. This encompasses all Census Race categories except White.

## Data Sources

This analysis leverages data from multiple sources to ensure a comprehensive overview:
- Greater Washington Partnership Inclusive Growth Dashboard
- Urban Institute Mobility Dashboard
- Census Profiles

## Analysis Goals and Objectives

The project aims to shed light on various indicators of distress such as income, wage, poverty, educational attainment, and unemployment rates—both in aggregate and disaggregated by race—to inform policy and interventions aimed at fostering equity and inclusive growth.

### Key Indicators

- **Income**
- **Wage**
- **Poverty**
- **Educational attainment**
- **Unemployment**

### Detailed Objectives

1. **Compare PlanRVA footprint data** with other regions on the stated indicators.
2. **Focus on underserved populations**, presenting data both in aggregate and disaggregated by race.
3. **Visualize data** using comparisons of numbers, percentages, and bar charts.

## Mapping Analysis

### Objectives

Create maps for the PlanRVA footprint at the Census Tract level to show:
- Percentage of the population under poverty.
- Demographic breakdowns under poverty (Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, and all underserved race categories combined).

### Key Questions

- What percentage of the population in PlanRVA's footprint are underserved?
- What percentage of the population is under poverty?
- Identify concentrated pockets of poverty within the region.

## Comparative Analysis with Other Regions

### Objectives

- **Median Household Income**: Compare our region's median household income to others and analyze it by race categories.
- **Unemployment Rate**: Analyze and compare overall unemployment rates and by race categories within the region.
- **Educational Attainment**: Assess and compare across the same dimensions.

### Potential Comparison Cities

- **Louisville/Jefferson Metro Area, Kentucky**
- **Nashville Metro Area**
- **Baltimore Metro Area**
- And more, focusing on specific counties within these metro areas as outlined in the project instructions.
